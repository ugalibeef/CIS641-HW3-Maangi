### What's this project all about?
My project is entitled Travel Lingo, this project is aimed at bridging the language barrier tourists encounter as they travel to regions whose people don't necessarily speak the tourist's language. This will revolutionaries the experience of learning a new language and getting started with the basics to overall improve the tourist’s user experience. In this project my main aim is to incorporate the use of System Analysis and Design methods through the use of UML to work on the acceptable software development practices. All aspects of the conceptual and physical design shall be employed in the final deliverable. Behavioral models such as State machines diagrams, sequence and interaction diagrams will be put into usage. Other critical aspects that this project touches are working with Class, Use case and Object Diagraming, as well as software requirements engineering. Through the development of this project, I am positive that I possess the desired system Analysis and Design skills would take any development company to the next level.
